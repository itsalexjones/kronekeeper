The files in this directory are only needed if you wish to import
.KRN files created by the Clyde Electronics KRIS software. Otherwise
they are not needed and can be safely ignored or deleted.

The file KRNtoCSV.exe is tested to work under Linux using Wine. The
Visual Basic 6 project files and source code are provided, comprising:

KRNtoCSV.vbp
KRNtoCSV.vbw
Main.bas

Example usage (on Linux, under wine):
DISPLAY=:1 wine32 KRNtoCSV.exe [path to KRN file]

The software reads the supplied KRN file and extracts all its data
tables to CSV files in the current directory.

There is no graphical output (or debugging/log information), however
being visual basic, some kind of graphical display is needed. On a
headless server, Xvnc, Xvfb or the Xdummy display driver are good
solutions. 

The software depends on three Microsoft redistributable components,
which are provided in case they are not already installed in your
Wine directory.

Microsoft Data Access Components
Microsoft Jet
Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Runtime DLL
